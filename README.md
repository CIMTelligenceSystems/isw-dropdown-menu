# \<isw-dropdown-menu\>

Material Design Polymer 2.0 Dropdown Menu (with multi-select).

Simple dropdown menu like paper-dropdown-menu, but drops "any kind of content" support in favour of multi-select.

Implemented as an simple combination of paper-input, paper-listbox and iron-dropdown.

```html
<isw-dropdown-menu multi label="Dinosaurs">
  <paper-item>Allosaurus</paper-item>
  <paper-item>Brontosaurus</paper-item>
  <paper-item>Carcharodontosaurus</paper-item>
  <paper-item>Diplodocus</paper-item>
</isw-dropdown-menu>
```

It looks like webcomponents.org cannot parse a 2.0 element yet. See docs inside the source.
